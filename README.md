## Description
VisionFit is a comprehensive fitness application that integrates Google's ML Kit Pose Detection technology, offering a unique approach to maintaining correct exercise form. Designed for fitness enthusiasts of all levels, VisionFit provides real-time feedback on the execution of various exercises, including pushups, squats, and weightlifting, with ongoing development for situps and more. The application boasts an array of features aimed at enhancing user engagement and workout effectiveness: Daily Challenges, Leaderboard, My Rewards, and My Statistics.

## Installation
The VisionFit app can be installed via a downloadable APK, created using Android Studio. Users can directly install this APK on their Android devices. Plans are in place to make VisionFit available on the Google Play Store to streamline the installation process and reach a wider audience.

## Usage
### Initial Setup
Upon installation, users encounter the login page, where they must register by entering their username, password, email, date of birth, and country of region. Successful registration leads back to the login page for subsequent access with the registered credentials.

### Homepage
Post-login, the homepage displays the user's workout streak at the top, highlighting consecutive days of challenge completion. The page includes icons for Daily Challenges, Leaderboard, My Rewards, and My Statistics, providing swift navigation.

### Daily Challenges
This feature promotes regular exercise through targeted challenges for situps, pushups, squats, and weightlifting. Each exercise is represented by an icon, clicking which activates the camera for form checking and rep counting. Users initiate sessions with a start button, facing a countdown to complete the required reps. Successful completion of challenges updates the streak count and changes the exercise icon color to green.

### Leaderboard
The Leaderboard showcases user rankings based on all-time reps for each exercise. Selection of an exercise icon filters the leaderboard accordingly, presenting a competitive yet friendly environment for users to see where they stand among peers.

### My Rewards (Work in Progress)
Envisioned as a motivation tool, My Rewards will allow users to earn points per rep, which can be redeemed for various rewards, enhancing the gamification aspect of the app.

### My Statistics
The statistics page offers an in-depth view of a user's performance, featuring the all-time longest streak and the best number of reps for each exercise challenge, encouraging users to break their records.

### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar at the bottom of the VisionFit app is a user-friendly interface element that provides quick access to various features of the application:
- **Logout**: Clicking this icon securely logs the user out, redirects them to the login page, and ensures that all data and progress are saved for the next session.
- **Home Page**: Redirects users back to the main homepage with the 4 main features of the app.
- **Settings**: Allows users to edit their profile, change the password, add a payment method, toggle night mode, manage notifications, and access About Us and Privacy Policy.
